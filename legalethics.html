      12552. December 8, 2022)</a
    >
    <p>
      It has oft-repeatedly been enunciated that "notarization is not an empty,
      meaningless, [ and] routinary act. It is invested with substantive public
      interest, such that only those who are qualified or authorized may act as
      notaries public." To protect that interest, anyone who is not qualified or
      authorized to act must be precluded from exercising such authority upon
      the public, the courts, and the administrative offices in general. Thus,
      without the requisite notarial commission, a lawyer is proscribed from
      performing any of the notarial acts allowed under the Notarial Rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the case of Nunga v. Atty. Viray, the Court ruled that a member of the
      Bar who notarizes a document at a time when he or she had no authorization
      or commission to do so may be subjected to a disciplinary action for
      having violated the Notarial Rules as well as the Lawyer's Oath and the
      Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, by performing notarial acts with an expired notarial
      commission, Atty. Solilapsi violated Section 11, Rule III of the Notarial
      Rules, the Lawyer's Oath, and Rule 1.01, Canon 1 and Canon 7 of the CPR,
      which provides:
    </p>

    <p>
      Canon 1 -A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land
      and promote respect for law and legal processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rule 1.01 -A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or
      deceitful conduct. 
      <p>Canon 7 -A lawyer shall at all times uphold the
        integrity and dignity of the legal profession and support the activities
        of the integrated bar.</p>
